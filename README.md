# Ecological-niche-modelling
Ecological niche modeling is one of the key research area in the field of ecology and conservation biology. The goal of this project is to identify the key environmental covariates/predictors that would be suitable for the spread of invasive species. The invasive plant Mikania micrantha was chosen as the test-bed species and the prediction of occurrence location was obtained for the Indian subcontinent. The occurrence records(longitude/latitude) were obtained from GBIF (http://www.gbif.org/). Nineteen climatic variables were obtained from WorldClim(http://www.worldclim.org/). Background points were used to supplement the absence records to create the binary response variable. The environmental covariates were chosen using logistic regression. Due to presence of multicollinearity, regularization techniques like ridge and lasso regression were utilized.  Out of the 19 variables, 7 were selected using regularized logistic regression through lasso.
